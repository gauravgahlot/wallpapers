# Wallpaper Collection

## Credits

This wallpaper collection is borrowed from **Derek Taylor**'s [wallpaper collection](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers).
If you haven't checked his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) already, I would highly recommend you do that.


## Where Did he Get These?

These wallpapers come from a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).
Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that he installed over the years.

## Style of Wallpapers

The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos.
There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in.

## Ownership

Because he downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images.
If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
